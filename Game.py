class Game:   
#Rules*******************************************
#Blackjack starts with players making bets.
#Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).
#Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand
#Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.
#The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.
#Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).
